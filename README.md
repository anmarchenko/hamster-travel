# Hamster Travel

This is a second take on my personal travel planner that we as a family use since 2014. This version is a full rewrite of the project and is under active development right now (deployed on [https://hamster-travel.fly.dev](https://hamster-travel.fly.dev) right now). You can read a bit more about planned features on my [personal website](https://www.amarchenko.de/hamster-travel/).

The old version is still in use and available on [https://travel.hmstr.rocks](https://travel.hmstr.rocks/en/landing) (source code for the old Hamster Travel is also on [github](https://github.com/anmarchenko/hamster_travel_legacy)).

## Prerequisites

- [elixir](https://elixir-lang.org)
- [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org)

## Run locally

Run the following commands to setup dependencies and create the database:

```bash
mix deps.get
mix ecto.setup
```

Run server:

```bash
mix phx.server
```

Visit `http://localhost:4000` to start using the app.
Use credentials from `priv/repo/seeds.exs`, for example `bunny@hamsters.test` with password `test1234`.

## Run tests

```bash
mix test
```

## Lint

```bash
mix credo --strict
```

## Deployment

I deploy the app on [fly.io](https://fly.io). See the Fly.io documentation on running an Elixir application [here](https://fly.io/docs/elixir/getting-started/). The release configuration is in the [fly.toml](https://github.com/altmer/hamster-travel/blob/master/fly.toml).

TLDR: perform first deploy by running `fly launch` and subsequent deploys by running `fly deploy`.
